# Book-Scrabble
Overview: Scrabble Online is a project aimed at creating a multi-player, online version of the classic word game Scrabble, with both host and guest modes, using a JavaFX event-driven interface. The game allows up to 4 players in host mode and 1 player in guest mode to play together, either locally or remotely, with smooth communication with the server and other players. The server-side handles game logic and state management, and the client-side provides an intuitive, easy-to-use interface for players to interact with the game.
